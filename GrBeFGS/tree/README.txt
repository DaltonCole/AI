Questions:
Not 100% if this constitutes as a tree search.
I would appreciate any feed back on it! Thanks!
----------------------------------
Things to Note:
Indefently runs on input4 and input5.
I could randomize the order to see if it would successfully complete
sometimes, however, inputs 1-3 would not always work then.
